                        Our First Real 8log post. there were a couple 8efore this 8ut those were only for Testing (i deleted em 8y accident lol). this one is kinda too t8h<br>
eventually well put up a 8uncha Tutorials to show u how 2 make a site like this on ur own. we learned a lot making it. its still Unfinished, 8ut i think its finally in a decently presenta8le St8<br>
Roadmap:
<ul>
		<li>different styling for art vs text posts</li>
		<li>fix all the 8orked Links n may8e add some new ones</li>
		<li>uhhhhh learn how to sew</li>
		<li>i didnt rly put much thought into this 8efore starting is kinda just stream of consciousness</li>
</ul>
<br>
rn we just have a lil script in 8ash and PHP to write posts using nvim and insert them automatically. posts r written in HTML so in theory we can put whatever we want in here

love, Noises
